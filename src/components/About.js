              I studied at the University of Texas at Austin and I loved learning about Sociology, Marketing, and Communications. After my Undergraduate years, I began working as a Public Relations Coordinator for a software company.

            <img src={sailormoon1} alt="Sailor Moon studying" className="about-icons" />
            <p>
              As a Public Relations Coordinator, I wrote several articles about our company's software. My interest in software originated from wanting to write better quality press releases. I knew that I had to research about software development if I wanted to write better! That's when I sought the software engineers in the company asked them about how software is built.

            <img src={sailormars1} alt="Sailor Moon studying" className="about-icons" />
            <p>
              From there, I was hooked! I love learning how things are built or made and learning about software development was really fun. I used FreeCodeCamp to learn how to code in my own free time and watched YouTube videos as well. When I moved to California, I decided to look more into coding and wanted to pursue web development as a career. That's when I chose to enroll in an immersive coding bootcamp!

            <p>
              At bootcamp, I learned full-stack development and various web technologies. During my time here, I developed 2 personal projects. After successfully completing the program, I wanted to improve on my logic so I started picking up data structures and algorithms and I am polishing my projects and collaborate with other Junior Developers on weekly HTML and CSS challenges to maintain my technical skills.
